**Usage Guide for Helmet Detection Using YOLOv8**

Welcome to the Helmet Detection Using YOLOv8 project! This project utilizes the YOLOv8 model specifically trained for detecting helmets in images and videos. Below is a comprehensive guide on how to set up and use this project effectively.

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iemtejasvi/Helmet-Detection.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   Once cloned, move into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Helmet-Detection
   ```

3. **Create and Activate Conda Environment:**

   Create a Conda environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   conda create -n helmet_detection python=3.9.1
   conda activate helmet_detection
   ```

4. **Install Requirements:**

   Install the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

5. **Run the Helmet Detection Script:**

   Execute the main Python script (`main.py`) by providing the path to the directory containing your images or videos:

   ```bash
   python main.py /path/to/images_or_videos
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/images_or_videos` with the actual path to the directory containing the images or videos you want to perform helmet detection on.

### Model

The project utilizes YOLOv8, an advanced variant of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. This specific model is trained to detect helmets accurately in various scenarios.

### Limitations

- The effectiveness of helmet detection may vary depending on factors such as lighting conditions, helmet size, orientation, and occlusion.
- While YOLOv8 is known for its efficiency and accuracy, it may not perform optimally in all scenarios and may require fine-tuning on specific datasets for improved accuracy.
- Processing large videos or a large number of high-resolution images may require substantial computational resources.
